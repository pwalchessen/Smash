# Administrative Stuff

Going to be using Python as our primary language.

# Idea:
The paper uses MinHash. Replicate what the paper does with SimHash as opposed to SimHash

Proposal Deadline is one week 26th
One page write-up on our idea. 

# Division of labor for the proposal:


What is the method you want to develop?
How will you evaluate your method?


What input data (sequencing reads, genomes, etc) do you need for your experiments?

- S. cerevisiae
- S. pombe
- E. coli

List of at least 3 milestones: tasks to accomplish on the way to the research goal

1. Replicating MinHash Data
2. Implementing SimHash algorithm
3. Benchmarking Min vs Sim
	Sketch size as a function of k, RMSE

List of at least 2 stretch goals: things to do if you finish milestones sooner than expected

1. Expand to full genome, multiple full genomes with varying GC content, redundancy etc.
2. Determining optimal k?
3. 

Papers to reference:

1. MinHash paper
2. SimHash paper
3. MinHash v. SimHash
